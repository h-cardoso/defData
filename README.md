# defData
Dynamic, Easy and Fast data integration for Oracle

Oh no, not another ORM!!!
defData does not aims to be an ORM (Object-relational mapping), if you are locking for an ORM for Oracle, this project is not for you!
The main goal is to provide access to dynamic data in oracle databases as easy and fast as possible. Dynamic data can be considered as any structure of data that is not known by the developer and the use of typed objects is not possible.
